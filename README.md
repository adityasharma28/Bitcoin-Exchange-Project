# Bitcoin-Exchange-Project
This project is about Bitcoin exchange rate that will fetch the most up-to-date exchange rates for different currencies and report them to the user. For this, we will use an interesting library stack including some of the STL. To work on this project, I'm going to employ the use of two libraries, libcurl and JSON for modern C++. We will use the libcurl to make the web calls to the JSON API and then we will use the JSON parser to read the response and build the data structures for us to use to access this data.
